# Collier Cobb's Personal Portfolio Web Application

A work in progress, this web application is designed to display Collier Cobb's current and future projects with the aim of procuring a job in software development.

The application was developed using CSS features such as flexbox and CSS variables, and with particular attention to viewport responsiveness through media queries.

ALL projects are subject to change and will be updated accordingly.

## Usage

The portfolio can be accessed [here](https://colcob98.github.io/collier-cobb-personal-portfolio/).

## Contributions

The reset.css file was adapted from UNC bootcamp class files.

The CSS formatting of banner stripes was inspired by Chris Coyier's [CSS Tricks Guide](https://css-tricks.com/stripes-css/).
